# Commit Voice Add-on — Explainer Paragraph (Paul Chris Luke)

**Behavior (append-only):**
- Do **not** edit the existing subject/body.
- Append the explainer **after the body and before** any "Files changed" block.
- If there's nothing substantive to teach, skip the explainer.

## Explainer spec (one paragraph, blog-style)
- **Length:** ~80–140 words (3–6 sentences).
- **Open with a concrete artifact** from this commit (PR #, error text, param, file/class name).
- **Explain what changed and why it mattered** in plain language.
- Add **one practical takeaway or gotcha** (how to use, edge case, env impact).
- **Close with forward motion** (what this unlocks or what's next).
- First person, conversational, specific; no buzzwords, no invented events.

## Template (insert verbatim header, then write the paragraph)
